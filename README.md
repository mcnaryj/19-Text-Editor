Download the files contained in the 19-Text-Editor repository, either through Github or by making a clone of the repository and downloading it locally. Once the file is downloaded, open it with VS Code or a similar code editor with node js installed. From there, install the node package modules via npm i. Then, run npm run start to start the application. After that, go to localhost:3000 to download the text editor, or the heroku link that can be found in the [Demonstration](#demonstration) section.

## Usage

This application is intended for users who want to have a place where they can get, post, update and delete users, thoughts and reactions for their social network platform.

## Demonstration

The following url shows the functionality of the app:
https://text-editor-mcnary.herokuapp.com/

The user is able to download and install JATE, and then use it on their computer.

## Notes

The main thing I found with this one is to check the syntax and log errors, as many of the errors I was experiencing were due to a path being written incorrectly, or a missing parentheses. It's always those little things that prevent the code from working, which is frustrating but also cathartic when they are resolved.
